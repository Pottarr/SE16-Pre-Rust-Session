## Lab 1 Introduce Yourself

### Code:

```rust
fn main() {
    print!("My name is Pottarrpongs "); //Firstname
    println!("Wongsanunt"); //Lastname
    println!("29th February 2005"); //Birthday
    println!("Golden Apple"); //Favorite Food
}
```

### Output:

```
My name is Pottarrpongs Wongsanunt
29th February 2005
Golden Apple
```

### Explanation

#### Difference between "print" and "println"

"println" starts a new line everytime while "print"" doesn't.

#### Code:

```rust
print!("Hello1");
print!("Hello2");
```

#### Output:

```
Hello1Hello2
```

<br>

#### Code:

```rust
println!("Hello1");
println!("Hello2");
```

### Output:

```
Hello1
Hello2
```

## Lab 2 Volume Calculator

#### Code

```rust
fn main() {
    let sphere_rad = 1.0;
    let cylinder_rad = 1.0;
    let cylinder_h = 1.0;
    let cone_rad = 1.0;
    let cone_h = 1.0;

    // In this case, we use 3.14 as a value of Pi.
    let sphere_vol = (4.0/3.0)*3.14*sphere_rad*sphere_rad*sphere_rad;
    let cylinder_vol = 3.14*cylinder_rad*cylinder_rad*cylinder_h;
    let cone_vol = (1.0/3.0)*3.14*cone_rad*cone_rad*cone_h;

    println!("The volume of the sphere is {sphere_vol:.1}");
    println!("The volume of the cylinder is {cylinder_vol:.1}");
    println!("The volume of the cone is {cone_vol:.1}");
}
```

### Output:

```
The volume of the sphere is 4.2
The volume of the cylinder is 3.1
The volume of the cone is 1.0
```

### Explanation

#### Volume Formula

#### Sphere: $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$

#### Cylinder: $\pi r^{2} h$

#### Cone: $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^{2} h$

#### Floating Point Precision

From the code above

```rust
println!("The volume of the sphere is {sphere_vol:.1}");
```

We could see the variable "sphere_vol" with following ":.1".
We can adjust decimal places by changing the number.

#### For example:

```rust
let num = 1.2345
println!("The number is around {num:.3}");
```

#### Output:

```
The number is around 1.234
```

<br>

Notice that the output's decimal places is exactly 3 digits.

## Lab 3 Speed Limit

### Code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let speed = 120;
    let min_speed = 40;
    let max_speed = 120;

    if speed < min_speed {
        println!("you are driving below speed limit by {} km/hr", min_speed-speed);
    } else if { speed <= min_speed || speed >= max_speed } {
        println!("you are driving within the speed limit");
    } else {
        println!("you are driving above speed limit by {} km/hr", speed-max_speed);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
you are driving within the speed limit
```

### Explanation

You can use "if-else" statement to conditionally change the flow of statement execution.

```rust
if speed < min_speed {
    println!("you are driving below speed limit by {} km/hr", min_speed-speed);
} else if { speed <= max_speed && speed >= min_speed } {
    println!("you are driving within the speed limit");
} else {
    println!("you are driving above speed limit by {} km/hr", speed-max_speed);
}
```

The following part explain how the code work.

1. In line 1, if your condition is true(speed < 40 km/hr), the message from the second line will be displayed. If your speed >= 40 km/hr, the condition in the first line will be false, leading the code to skip to line 2 and move on to line 3.
2. In line 3, just like earlier, if your condition is true(40 km/hr < speed < 120 km/hr), your code in the 4th line will be executed, displaying the message written in line 4. If not, it'll skip to line 5.
3. In line 5, you can see the "else" statement. Any other conditions not following line 1 and 3 will be execute here, showing the message written in line 6.

#### Cleaner Code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let speed = 120;
    let min_speed = 40;
    let max_speed = 120;

    if speed < min_speed {
        println!("you are driving below speed limit by {} km/hr", min_speed-speed);
    }
    if max_speed >= speed && speed >= min_speed {
        println!("you are driving within the speed limit");
    }
    if speed > max_speed {
        println!("you are driving above speed limit by {} km/hr", speed-max_speed);
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
you are driving within the speed limit
```

#### Explanation

You can also write only "if" statement to finish the job. Your speed is below the minimum speed, the message will be displayed normally because the remaining conditions is not true at the time making the remaining "if" statement not executable.

## Lab 4 Odd/Positive Number

### Code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = 2;

    if num < 0 {
        if num % 2 == 0 {
            println!("{} is a negative even number", num);
        } else {
            println!("{} is a negative odd number", num);
        }
    } else {
        if num % 2 == 0 {
            println!("{} is a positive even number", num);
        } else {
            println!("{} is a positive odd number", num);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

#### Main Ideas

We know the difference between Odd and Even numbers. Even numbers are divisible by 2 while Odd number aren't.

## Special Lab Triangle

Build a triangle using "\*".

### Expected output:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
********
*********
**********
```

### Code:

#### Using for loop:

```rust
fn main() {
    for i in 1..=10 {
        for _j in 1..=i{
            print!("*");
    }
    println!("");
    }
}
```

#### Using while loop:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut i = 1;
    let mut j = 1;
    while i <= 10 {
        while j <= i {
            print!("*");
            j+=1;
        }
        println!("");
        i+=1;
        j = 1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

The concept of the For Loop and While Loop will be explain in the "Rust Lecture 26th.pdf" file in the google drive embed. In this page we will go through how the code works.

#### For loop

```rust
for i in 1..=10 {
    for _j in 1..=i{
        print!("*");
    }
    println!("");
}
```

The following part explain how the code work.

1. The code starts at line 1 where the i for loop(i loop) is set.
2. We set another for loop (\_j loop).(We can also declare with "j" and compile but the compiler will throw a warning for the unused variable. [For more information](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint_defs/builtin/static.UNUSED_VARIABLES.html))
3. The loop run for the 1 time, print out "\*" and move out of the \_j loop.
4. The program starts a new line using "println" macro and end the i loop for the first time
5. The i loop starts the second time and goes for the \_j loop.
6. The \_j loop runs for 2 times (because i loop is now running in the 2nd round) and print out "\*\*" and move out the \_j loop.
7. The program starts the new line and exit again and the program runs until the i loop reach 10 times.

#### While Loop

```rust
let mut i = 1;
let mut j = 1;
    while i <= 10 {
        while j <= i {
            print!("*");
            j+=1;
        }
        println!("");
        i+=1;
        j = 1;
    }
```

The following part explain how the code work.

1. We declare a mutable variable i = 1 and j = 1.
2. We set the i while loop(i loop) to make the program stops when i == 10.
3. Inside the i loop, we set a new while loop(j loop) to make the program stop when j == i.
4. Inside the j loop ,the program will print "\*" continuously until j adds up to i times.
5. The program starts a new line using "println" macro, adds up i by 1 and assigns j = 1 to reset the j loop.
6. The process continues until i adds up to 10.
